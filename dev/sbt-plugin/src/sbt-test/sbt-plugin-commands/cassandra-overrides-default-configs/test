# Structure of this test:
# =======================

# Here we test that it is possible to override the default injected configuration values for cassandra via the 
# application.conf.
# The 1 second sleep is needed to allow to compile and start the application, as the test harness expects 
# a configuration file to be created as soon as application is started. The waiting time might be too short 
# on some machine, potentially leading to spurious failures of this test. If that happens the sleeping time 
# should be increased.
