# Structure of this test:
# =======================

# Here we test the default injected configuration values for cassandra. Note that the keyspace name is defaulted 
# to the project's name. Furthermore, because the syntax for naming a keyspace is quite strict, in this test we 
# are also validating that the project's name normalization logic works for common sbt project's name (e.g., 
# when containing hyphen or backtick).
# The 1 second sleep is needed to allow to compile and start the application, as the test harness expects 
# a configuration file to be created as soon as application is started. The waiting time might be too short 
# on some machine, potentially leading to spurious failures of this test. If that happens the sleeping time 
# should be increased.
