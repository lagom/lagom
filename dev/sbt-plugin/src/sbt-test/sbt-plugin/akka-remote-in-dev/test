# Structure of this test:
# =======================

# Here we test that akka remote uses non-conflicting ports for each service (2 services more precisely).
# Services a configured with akka-remote enabled (through Lagom Cluster).
# We also test that the behavior is the same when using Artery or Classical remote.


# First we start the services using Artery (default in 1.6.x) and
# we call endpoints in both services to prove they are up and running.
# `runAll` tests
# --------------
> runAll
> validateRequest retry-until-success http://localhost:10000/foo status 200 body-contains "ack foo"
> validateRequest retry-until-success http://localhost:10001/bar status 200 body-contains "ack bar"
> stop


# Next, we change each service configuration to use Remote Classical and we run the same test.

# Change configuration files (enable remote classical)
$ copy-file changes/a-application.conf a/impl/src/main/resources/application.conf
$ copy-file changes/b-application.conf b/impl/src/main/resources/application.conf

# re-run the same test using akka remote classical
> runAll
> validateRequest retry-until-success http://localhost:10000/foo status 200 body-contains "ack foo"
> validateRequest retry-until-success http://localhost:10001/bar status 200 body-contains "ack bar"
> stop
