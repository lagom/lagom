# Structure of this test:
# =======================

# Here we test that the dev mode service discovery is correct configured.
# The test is extremely simple, the /foo endpoint do a lookup using Akka Service Discovery to itself.
# The request must succeed and return the name of the service, ie: 'foo-service'.
# If Akka Service Discovery is wrongly configured this call will throw an exception.
