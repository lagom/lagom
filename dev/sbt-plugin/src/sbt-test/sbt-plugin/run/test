# Structure of this test:
# =======================

# Here we test that the `runAll` task does indeed reload on change - 
# for example, ensuring that it only reloads when the classpath changes, and testing 
# failure conditions.

# Additionally, when making assertions about reloads, we need to wait:
# 1) At least a second after changing the file before we make a request. The reason 
#    for this is that the classpath change detection is based on file modification 
#    times, which only have 1 second precision.
# 2) Another 6 seconds to allow the application to be recompiled and reloaded. Because 
#    we are waiting for "stuff" to happen in the background, it is possible that we 
#    should wait for longer on slower machines (i.e., this test has the potential of 
#    being flaky).
