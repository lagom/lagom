# Asserts we can switch HTTP backends in Lagom.
# To make sure we are actually using one backend or the other this test uses two implementations with
# similar code: each service has a single endpoint and the implementation for the endpoint will capture
# the stacktrace and filter byt words "akka" or "server" and return the resulting package/class names
# as strings in the response body. The scripted test asserts that the Akka HTTP service response contains
# 'akka' and similarly the netty service doesn't.
