# Integrating Maven projects with an IDE

If you worked through the command line example for [[Maven|GettingStartedMaven]], you have a Maven project that you can integrate into any Java IDE. 

To integrate Maven project with Eclipse or IntelliJ, import your project:

* Using the [m2eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/documentation/m2e-documentation.html) plugin in Eclipse.
* Using the built in [IntelliJ Maven](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/getting-started-with-maven.html) support.

When developing with Lagom you will often run several services in a single Java Virtual Machine. See how to [[increase Memory for Maven|JVMMemoryOnDev]].
