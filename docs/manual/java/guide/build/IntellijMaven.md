# Importing an existing Maven project into IntelliJ

If you worked through the command line example for [[Maven|GettingStartedMaven]], you have a Maven project that you can integrate into Intellij IDEA Using built in [IntelliJ Maven](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/getting-started-with-maven.html) support.

> **Note** When developing with Lagom you will often run several services in a single Java Virtual Machine. See how to [[increase Memory for Maven|JVMMemoryOnDev]].

To integrate an existing Maven Java project into IDEA, follow these steps:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and close any existing project.

1. From the `Welcome` screen, click **Import Project**.
    The `Select File or Directory to Import` dialog opens.
    
1. Navigate to your Maven project and select the top-level folder. For example, with a project named `my-first-system`:

    Your Maven project should be selected for import:

    The **Please select project SDK** screen opens.
    
1. Make sure the correct JDC is selected and click **Next**.

1. Change the project name and location if you like, and click **Finish**.

    1. Select **Maven**.
    1. Give your configuration a name.
    1. In the **Comand line:** field, enter `lagom:runAll`.
    1. Click **OK**.
    
1. Build your project and run it using the configuration you created. 
    The console displays the following when Lagom is running:

1. Verify that the services are indeed up and running by invoking the `hello` service endpoint from any HTTP client, such as a browser: 
    
    ```
    http://localhost:9000/api/hello/World
    ```
    The request returns the message `Hello, World!`.
