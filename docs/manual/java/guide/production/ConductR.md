# Lightbend ConductR

ConductR is a container orchestration tool with the main goal of delivering operational productivity. ConductR is also designed to host your Lagom services with resilience.

ConductR is free for using on up to 3 nodes and also comes with a "sandbox" so that you can run it locally to test your services. For more information on ConductR go to:

* [ConductR product page](https://www.lightbend.com/products/conductr)
* [ConductR documentation](https://conductr.lightbend.com)

This guide will explain how to:

* Install ConductR sandbox
* Start local ConductR cluster
* Conveniently package, load and run your entire Lagom system
* Package Lagom services individually
* Load and run services during and outside of development
