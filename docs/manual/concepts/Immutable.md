# Immutable Objects

An immutable object is an object that cannot be modified after it was created.

Immutable objects have two great advantages:

* Code based on immutable objects is clearer and likelier to be correct. Bugs involving unexpected changes simply can't occur.
* Multiple threads can safely access immutable objects concurrently.

In Lagom, immutable objects are required in several places, such as:

* Service request and response types
* Persistent entity commands, events, and states
* Publish and subscribe messages

## Mutable vs. immutable

Here is an example of a mutable object:

@[mutable](code/docs/home/immutable/MutableUser.java)

The setter methods can be used to modify the object after construction.

Here, by contrast, is an immutable object:

@[immutable](code/docs/home/immutable/ImmutableUser.java)

All fields are final and are assigned at construction time. There are no setter methods.

## Immutables

Lagom doesn't care how you define your immutable objects. You can write out the constructor and getters by hand, as in the above sample.  But we recommend using the [Immutables](https://immutables.github.io) tool to generate them instead. Using Immutables is easier and less error-prone than writing everything out by hand, and the resulting code is shorter and easier to read.

Here is the corresponding definition of a `User`, like the above `ImmutableUser`:

@[immutable](code/docs/home/immutable/AbstractUser.java)

For free you get things like:

* builders (very convenient when your class has many fields)
* correct `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString` implementations
* copy methods to make new instances based on old ones, e.g. `withEmail`

Immutables supports different "styles" of object. Compared to the [default style](https://immutables.github.io/style.html), `@ImmutableStyle` follows a convention that the abstract class or interface name starts with `Abstract` and that is trimmed from the generated class, e.g. `AbstractUser` vs `User`. To use the `@ImmutableStyle` annotation you need to add `lagomJavadslImmutables` to your project's library dependencies.

In maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.lightbend.lagom</groupId>
    <artifactId>lagom-javadsl-immutables_2.11</artifactId>
    <version>${lagom.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

In sbt:

@[lagom-immutables](code/lagom-immutables.sbt)

Immutables integrates with popular IDEs. Follow the instructions for [[Eclipse|ImmutablesInIDEs#Eclipse]] or [[IntelliJ IDEA|ImmutablesInIDEs#IntelliJ_IDEA]] to add the Immutables annotation processor to your IDE.

## Collections

If an immutable object contains a collection, that collection must be immutable too.

Here is an example of an object with a mutable collection in it:

@[mutable](code/docs/home/immutable/MutableUser2.java)

The object might look like immutable since it only has final fields and no setters, but the `List` of `phoneNumbers` is mutable, because it can be changed by code like `user.getPhoneNumbers().add("+468123456")`.

One possible fix would be to make a defensive copy of the `List` in the constructor and use `Collections.unmodifiableList` in the getter, like this:

@[immutable](code/docs/home/immutable/ImmutableUser2.java)

But it is easy to make mistakes when coding this way, so we again recommend letting Immutable handle it for you, as follows.

Here is a new definition of a `User2`, like the above `ImmutableUser2`:

@[immutable](code/docs/home/immutable/AbstractUser2.java)

The `getPhoneNumbers` method will return an instance of `com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList`.

### Guava and PCollections

As seen above, Immutables uses [Guava immutable collections](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ImmutableCollectionsExplained) by default.

The Guava collections are certainly better for this purpose than plain `java.util` collections. However, the Guava collections are cumbersome and inefficient for some common operations (for example, making a slightly modified copy of an existing collection).

Therefore, we recommend [PCollections](http://pcollections.org), which is a collection library that is designed from the ground up for immutability and efficiency.

This is how the above example looks like using a PCollection:

@[immutable](code/docs/home/immutable/AbstractUser3.java)

This is how to define an optional collection initialized with the empty collection:

@[immutable](code/docs/home/immutable/AbstractUser4.java)

### "Persistent" collections

There are two different and potentially confusing usages of the word "persistent" with respect to data.

You will see references, in the PCollections documentation and elsewhere, to ["persistent" data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure). There, the word "persistent" means that even when you construct a modified copy of a collection, the original "persists".

In the rest of this documentation, "persistent" refers instead to [persistent storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_%28computer_science%29), as in [[Persistent Entities|PersistentEntity]] and the examples below.

### Further reading

The Immutables documentation has more details on immutable collections [here](https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#array-collection-and-map-attributes).

## Example of PersistentEntity Commands

@[full-example](../guide/cluster/code/docs/home/persistence/BlogCommand.java)

A few things worth noting here:

* `@Value.Parameter` can be added to one or more properties to generate [constructor method](https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#constructor-method), which is more convenient than the full builder for classes with only a few properties
* `singleton = true` can be used for objects that don't have any properties, i.e. [singleton instances](https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#singleton-instances), also note that the visibility of the constructor should be reduced for such classes

### Example of PersistentEntity Events

@[full-example](../guide/cluster/code/docs/home/persistence/BlogEvent.java)

### Example of PersistentEntity State

@[full-example](../guide/cluster/code/docs/home/persistence/AbstractBlogState.java)

@[full-example](../guide/cluster/code/docs/home/persistence/AbstractPostContent.java)

A few things worth noting here:

* Java 8's `Optional` type can be used for [optional properties](https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#optional-attributes)
* You can [add more methods](https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#smart-data) to the classes, such as `withBody` and `isEmpty` above
* You can define [default values](https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#default-attributes) for optional properties, e.g. `isPublished` above
