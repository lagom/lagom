# What's in the name?

Lagom is a Swedish word [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom) "just the right amount".

Often, when people talk about microservices, they focus on the micro part, saying that a service should be small. We want to emphasize that the important thing when splitting a system into services is to find the right boundaries between services, aligning them with bounded contexts, business capabilities, and isolation requirements. As a result, a microservice-based system can achieve its scalability and resilience requirements, making it easy to deploy and manage.

So, the focus should not be on how small the services are, but rather on having services that are just the right size. They should be "Lagom" size services.
