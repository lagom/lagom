# Lightbend Reactive Platform

[Lightbend Reactive Platform](https://www.lightbend.com/products/lightbend-reactive-platform) is an application development solution powered by an open source core and commercial [Enterprise Suite](https://www.lightbend.com/platform/production) for building Reactive systems on the JVM. The open source components can be used via public repositories as normal, while **Enterprise Suite components are in a secure repository requiring Lightbend-provided credentials**.

We recommend that you use the Lightbend Enterprise Suite to take advantage of the [Split Brain Resolver](https://tech-hub.lightbend.com/docs/akka-commercial-addons/current/split-brain-resolver.html) and the [Diagnostics Recorder](https://tech-hub.lightbend.com/docs/akka-commercial-addons/current/diagnostics-recorder.html).

Read about the importance of the Split Brain Resolver in the [[Cluster Downing|Cluster#Downing]] documentation.

You need to adjust the build in your project to use the Lightbend Reactive Platform. Follow the setup instructions in the Reactive Platform documentation for your build tool of choice:

* [Reactive Platform setup for sbt](https://tech-hub.lightbend.com/docs/reactive-platform/2.0/setup/setup-sbt.html)
* [Reactive Platform setup for Maven](https://tech-hub.lightbend.com/docs/reactive-platform/2.0/setup/setup-maven.html)

You can find documentation for the complete Reactive Platform at the [Lightbend Tech Hub](https://tech-hub.lightbend.com/docs/).
