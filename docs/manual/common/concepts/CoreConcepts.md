# Lagom core concepts

Lagom provides tools and APIs that guide developers to build a system out of microservices.  The key to success is good architecture, rooted in a solid understanding of microservices concepts and best practices.

The philosophy behind Lagom is presented in [Reactive Microservices Architecture: Design Principles for Distributed Systems](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/reactive-microservices-architecture.html), a report by Jonas Bon√©r, available free.  We strongly recommend reading it before learning Lagom. Much of the following documentation builds upon and refers back to this report.
