/**
 * A `PersistentEntity` has a stable entity identifier, with which
 * it can be accessed from anywhere in the cluster. It is run by an actor
 * and the state is persistent using event sourcing.
 *
 * `initialState` and `behavior` are abstract methods that your concrete subclass must implement.
 * The behavior is defined as a set of actions given a state. The actions are functions to process
 * incoming commands and persisted events.
 *
 * The `PersistentEntity` receives commands of type `Command` that can be validated before
 * persisting state changes as events of type `Event`. The functions that process incoming
 * commands are registered in the `Actions` using `onCommand` of the
 * `Actions`.
 *
 * A command may also be read-only and only perform some side-effect, such as replying
 * to the request. Such command handlers are registered using `onReadOnlyCommand`
 * of the `Actions`. Replies are sent with the `reply` method of the context that
 * is passed to the command handler function.
 *
 * A command handler returns a `Persist` directive that defines what event or events,
 * if any, to persist. Use the `thenPersist`, `thenPersistAll` or `done` methods of the
 * context that is passed to the command handler function to create the `Persist` directive.
 *
 * When an event has been persisted successfully the state of type `State` is updated by
 * applying the event to the current state. The functions for updating the state are
 * registered with the `onEvent` method of the `Actions`.
 * The event handler returns the new state. The state must be immutable, so you return
 * a new instance of the state. Current state is passed as parameter to the event handler.
 * The same event handlers are also used when the entity is started up to recover its
 * state from the stored events.
 *
 * After persisting an event, external side effects can be performed in the `afterPersist`
 * function that can be defined when creating the `Persist` directive.
 * A typical side effect is to reply to the request to confirm that it was performed
 * successfully. Replies are sent with the `reply` method of the context that is passed
 * to the command handler function.
 *
 * The event handlers are typically only updating the state, but they may also change
 * the behavior of the entity in the sense that new functions for processing commands
 * and events may be defined for a given state. This is useful when implementing
 * finite state machine (FSM) like entities.
 *
 * When the entity is started the state is recovered by replaying stored events.
 * To reduce this recovery time the entity may start the recovery from a snapshot
 * of the state and then only replaying the events that were stored after the snapshot.
 * Such snapshots are automatically saved after a configured number of persisted events.
 *
 * @tparam Command the super type of all commands, must implement [[PersistentEntity.ReplyType]]
 *   to define the reply type of each command type
 * @tparam Event the super type of all events
 * @tparam State the type of the state
