/**
 * A `PersistentEntity` has a stable entity identifier, with which
 * it can be accessed from anywhere in the cluster. It is run by an actor
 * and the state is persistent using event sourcing.
 *
 * `initialBehavior` is an abstract method that your concrete subclass must implement.
 * It returns the `Behavior` of the entity. The behavior consists of current state
 * and functions to process incoming commands and persisted events.
 *
 * The `PersistentEntity` receives commands of type `Command` that can be validated before
 * persisting state changes as events of type `Event`. The functions that process incoming
 * commands are registered in the `Behavior` using `setCommandHandler` of the
 * `BehaviorBuilder`.
 *
 * A command may also be read-only and only perform some side-effect, such as replying
 * to the request. Such command handlers are registered using `setReadOnlyCommandHandler`
 * of the `BehaviorBuilder`. Replies are sent with the `reply` method of the context that
 * is passed to the command handler function.
 *
 * A command handler returns a `Persist` directive that defines what event or events,
 * if any, to persist. Use the `thenPersist`, `thenPersistAll` or `done` methods of the
 * context that is passed to the command handler function to create the `Persist` directive.
 *
 * When an event has been persisted successfully the state of type `State` is updated by
 * applying the event to the current state. The functions for updating the state are
 * registered with the `setEventHandler` method of the `BehaviorBuilder`.
 * The event handler returns the new state. The state must be immutable, so you return
 * a new instance of the state. Current state can be accessed from the event handler with
 * the `state` method of the `PersistentEntity`. The same event handlers are also used when
 * the entity is started up to recover its state from the stored events.
 *
 * After persisting an event, external side effects can be performed in the `afterPersist`
 * function that can be defined when creating the `Persist` directive.
 * A typical side effect is to reply to the request to confirm that it was performed
 * successfully. Replies are sent with the `reply` method of the context that is passed
 * to the command handler function.
 *
 * The event handlers are typically only updating the state, but they may also change
 * the behavior of the entity in the sense that new functions for processing commands
 * and events may be defined. This is useful when implementing finite state machine (FSM)
 * like entities. Event handlers that change the behavior are registered with the
 * `setEventHandlerChangingBehavior` of the `BehaviorBuilder`. Such an event handler
 * returns the new `Behavior` instead of just returning the new state. You can
 * access current behavior with the `behavior` method of the `PersistentEntity`
 * and using the `builder` method of the `Behavior`.
 *
 * When the entity is started the state is recovered by replaying stored events.
 * To reduce this recovery time the entity may start the recovery from a snapshot
 * of the state and then only replaying the events that were stored after the snapshot.
 * Such snapshots are automatically saved after a configured number of persisted events.
 * The snapshot if any is passed as a parameter to the `initialBehavior` method and
 * you should use that state as the state of the returned `Behavior`.
 * One thing to keep in mind is that if you are using event handlers that change the
 * behavior (`setEventHandlerChangingBehavior`) you must also restore corresponding
 * `Behavior` from the snapshot state that is passed as a parameter to the `initialBehavior`
 * method.
 *
 * Type parameter `Command`:
 * the super type of all commands, must implement [[PersistentEntity.ReplyType]]
 * to define the reply type of each command type
 * Type parameter `Event`:
 * the super type of all events
 * Type parameter `State`:
 * the type of the state
