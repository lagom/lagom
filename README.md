# Lagom - The Reactive Microservices Framework

Lagom is a Swedish word meaning *just right, sufficient*. Microservices are about creating services that are just the right size, that is, they have just the right level of functionality and isolation to be able to adequately implement a scalable and resilient system.

Lagom focuses on ensuring that your application realises the full potential of the [Reactive Manifesto](http://reactivemanifesto.org), while delivering a high productivity development environment, and seamless production deployment experience.
